# IoT-Based-Weather-Reporting-System
The project aims to develop a smart and working humidity monitoring system, it allows people to directly check the humidity status.
System uses temperature, humidity as well as rain sensor to monitor humidity and provide live reporting of the humidity statistics.
The Brain of the project was an Arduino Board and the surrounding blocks are Digital and Analog sensors like DHT11, BMP180, MQ-135 Sensors.
